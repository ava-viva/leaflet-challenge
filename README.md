The USGS Earthquake Data Visualization project aims to develop compelling tools for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to showcase their extensive earthquake data. By creating engaging visualizations, our goal is to educate the public and government organizations about global issues and secure additional funding for the USGS. The project utilizes the Leaflet JavaScript library, known for its interactive mapping capabilities, to integrate the earthquake data seamlessly into a captivating visualization experience. Users can explore earthquake occurrences worldwide through an interactive map, customize their view with filtering options, and gain insights into patterns and trends. The visualization tool presents earthquake data using markers or visual indicators, providing essential details such as magnitude, depth, and occurrence date. Additionally, informative pop-ups offer users additional information about specific earthquake events. By enhancing the understanding of seismic activities, the USGS can effectively convey the urgency of their work and the need for continued support in addressing global challenges.
